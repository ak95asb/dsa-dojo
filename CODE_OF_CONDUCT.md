# Code of Conduct 🥋

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior ✅

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and accepting** constructive feedback gracefully
- **Focusing on what's best** for the community, not just ourselves
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Using welcoming** and inclusive language
- **Helping newcomers** learn and grow

### Unacceptable Behavior ❌

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests
- GitHub Discussions
- Code reviews
- Community events and meetups
- Any other community spaces

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainer directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature
of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved for a specified period of time. Violating these terms
may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time.
